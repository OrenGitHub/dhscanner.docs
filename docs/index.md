Dhscanner is a highly-parallel static code analyzer ( [SAST][1] engine ).
It aims to compete with established solutions like [Semgrep][2],
[Opengrep][3] and [CodeQl][5], while being **completely free** for both
public and **private** repositories. The feauture that allows it to
discriminate false positive findings is its ability to sematically understand
**user-input sanitation**. This feature enabled us to achieve a significantly low
false alarms ratio compared to other SAST solutions. 

!!! info "Info"
    Dhscanner was built as a collaborative research
    effort by a team of programming languages Phd's from [Tel Aviv University][6].

There are three ways to use dhscanner:

- From [CI/CD pipelines](getting_started/ci_cd.md) ( ðŸ‘ˆ preferred and easiest way )
- From the [CLI](getting_started/cli.md)
- Use our "monstrous" server ( mostly for research )

!!! info "Info"
    It is possible to shift your non-research workload to our server.
    Please [open up an issue][7] if this is relevant for your needs.
